# Web-based code editor

Run your code in Python, C#, Java, and JavaScript through a code editor where you can write and run code in the browser

Here's how it works:

1. Runs a temporary website with vite with a traditional editor interface
2. When (run code) is pressed, it grabs code text from your input and processes it with a Piston API
3. Returns accurate code output and errors

# Imporant Info

All necessary libraries are listed at the top imports

# How to run it locally

npm install

npm install axios

npm run dev
```
